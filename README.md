# Applied Algebra Tests

**Warning:** `bch` tests need one extra function `gf.polyadd(p1, p2)` which
adds two polynoms.

## Installation
Run the following command in the folder with `bch.py` and `gf.py`:
```
git clone https://github.com/nikitabobko/applied-algebra-tests.git
```

## Usage
Run the following command in the folder with `bch.py` and `gf.py`
```
python3 applied-algebra-tests

Also you can use:
```
